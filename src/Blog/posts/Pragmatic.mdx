i listened to an episode of the Future of Coding podcast last week, [Moving Beyond Syntax: Lessons from 20 Years of Blocks Programming in AgentSheets by Alexander Repenning](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/073).

had a thought.

the podcast talked about syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, in which semantics means "understanding what a piece of code means" and pragmatics means "understanding what the code does / means in context of the system and code around it".

that podcast is frequently obsessed with visual programming, as are many of the covered papers. their discussion was largely about blocks based programming and ways to visualize a block's potential input and output to play with it and better understand it in context. at least, that was my understanding. all good stuff.

this helped me frame the value of unit testing a bit differently.
